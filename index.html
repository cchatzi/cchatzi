                  Welcome to my website and personal sandbox. Before going any
                  further, let me introduce my self. My full name is Christos
                  Chatzicharalampous, and I was born in Heidelberg, Germany, in
                  the late 70s. As you understand, nobody uses my full name,
                  with friends and colleagues calling me Chris or Chatzi.

                  I worked for five years as a researcher - four during and
                  after my thesis - and another four years as a customer support
                  representative. During that time, I sharpened my skills and
                  added new ones. I became a great communicator and listener. I
                  learned how to stay focused, efficient, and on-time, even when
                  the pressure was increasing. I was fortunate enough to be
                  taught by my parents the importance of honesty, respect, and
                  philotimo. Life taught me empathy and patience.

                  I have a high desire to learn, and I invest the time to gain
                  in-depth knowledge of the product. I am great at
                  problem-solving and will go the extra mile to get the job
                  done, a friendly and easy-going person.

                  I only published the site for this application, and use it
                  mostly to practice and play around. I developt my skills,
                  mostly reading and taking classes at TeamTreehouse and
                  FrontendMasters. I started with HTML and CSS, and I am still
                  learning new things every day, expanding my knowledge on
                  Javascript and Python.
